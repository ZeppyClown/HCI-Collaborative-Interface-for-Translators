A flat list of BPE tokens + log-probs is **great for statistics** but **terrible for UI/UX** when what you really need is:

1. **Meaningful segments** (chunks the translator can recognise: NPs, VPs, clauses…).
2. **Alternative phrasings per segment**, not per token.
3. Automatic **re-generation of the _rest_** of the sentence after a segment is swapped (forward / backward).

Below is a practical roadmap that turns the raw `logprobs` dump into exactly that flow.

---

## 1 Segment → Phrase boundaries (the missing layer)

| Step | What to do                                                                                             | Common tooling                                             |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1a   | **Collapse BPE tokens → words.**<br>Strip the leading `Ġ` and join.                                    | Simple Python join / regex.                                |
| 1b   | **Syntactic chunking** of the English sentence to find NPs, VPs, PPs, adverbials…                      | `spaCy` (`en_core_web_trf`) or `nltk` constituency parser. |
| 1c   | **Map words ⟷ original token indices** so each chunk still knows _which_ `logprobs` rows belong to it. | Keep running counters while collapsing.                    |

This gives you a list like:

```python
segments = [
  { "id": 1, "type": "NP", "text": "An 80-year-long study", "token_span": (0, 6) },
  { "id": 2, "type": "VP", "text": "has shown that",        "token_span": (7,10) },
  { "id": 3, "type": "NP", "text": "good interpersonal relationships", "token_span": (11,16) },
  { "id": 4, "type": "VP", "text": "can make a person happier and healthier.", "token_span": (17, …) }
]
```

So far we have **structure**.

---

## 2 Harvest top-K _token_ alternatives → _segment_ candidates

For every segment:

1. Pull the rows in `logprobs.content[start:end]`.
2. For each position, gather the `top_logprobs` list (the alt tokens).
3. **Beam-combine** them but _only inside that span_ to form phrase alternatives.

   - Start with the original token string.
   - Replace at most _n_ tokens (n = 1–3 keeps combinatorics sane).
   - Score a candidate = **sum log-probs of its tokens**.

4. Keep the best-scoring, grammatically valid 3-5 variants.

If you’d rather skip DIY beams, a single extra OpenAI call per segment works even better:

```python
prompt = f"""The full sentence is:
  "{full_sentence}"

Give me 5 alternative phrasings for the highlighted span
<<<{segment_text}>>> that keep the sentence fluent."""
```

You **still attach `logprobs` on that follow-up call**, so you can rank those variants too.

---

## 3 Represent it all in JSON for the frontend

```json
{
  "sentence": "...",
  "segments": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "text": "An 80-year-long study",
      "alternatives": [
        {"text": "A study spanning 80 years", "score": -3.21},
        {"text": "An eight-decade-long study", "score": -3.44}
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Your React/Streamlit UI:

- Renders each `segment.text` in a pill/bubble.
- On click, shows its `alternatives` as a dropdown.
- When an alt is picked, fire **`/regenerate`**.

## 4 Forward / Backward regeneration endpoint

### Request

```json
POST /regenerate
{
  "full_sentence": "…current draft…",
  "locked_segment_id": 3   // the one the user fixed
}
```

### Backend

```python
# Create a prompt of the form:
"""
Here is an English draft translation with one segment frozen:

[FROZEN] good interpersonal relationships [/FROZEN]
<Everything else may be rewritten to stay fluent and faithful.>

Source (Mandarin):
“一项长达80年的研究表明良好的人际关系能让一个人更幸福、更健康。”

Return the best full English sentence.
"""
#
# Call ChatCompletion with logprobs=True again
```

Return the new sentence **plus** a fresh set of segments & logprobs.
Because you froze the chosen segment, the model alters earlier or later text → **backward or forward effect**, exactly what Figure 3 illustrates.

## 5 Putting it together in your codebase

```
backend/
 ├─ translation_service.py      # original / regenerate calls
 ├─ segmentation_service.py     # spaCy / rule-based chunker
 ├─ altphrase_service.py        # beam or extra-prompt generation
 └─ api.py                      # Flask / FastAPI routes
frontend/
 └─ CAT_UI.jsx                  # renders segments, handles clicks
```

Each module is independent; swapping one strategy (e.g., constituency parser → GPT chunker) doesn’t break the rest.

---

### TL;DR

_BPE tokens → words → syntactic segments → phrase-level alternates → bidirectional regeneration._

That pipeline:

1. Keeps translators focused on **intuitive chunks**.
2. Uses log-probs for **data-driven candidate ranking**.
3. Preserves the **search-based, forward/backward interactive loop** the paper advocates.
