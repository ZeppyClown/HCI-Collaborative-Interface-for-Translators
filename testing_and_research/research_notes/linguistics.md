# Linguistics - Mechanics of a Sentence
**Language is intuitive**, so when you stop to formalize it (especially for building applications like yours), it can feel confusing.

Let’s break down the **linguistic anatomy of a sentence** — just like you would break down the structure of a program into functions, classes, and modules.

---

## 🧠 BIG PICTURE: What is a sentence made of?

A **sentence** is a *structured* collection of words that express a **complete thought**.
It has both:

* **Form** → the syntactic structure (grammar)
* **Function** → the roles each part plays (meaning)

We’ll go in layers:

---

### 🔹 1. **Phrases** (the “building blocks”)

A **phrase** is a group of words that acts like **one unit**. It can’t stand alone as a sentence, but it does a specific job **inside** a sentence.

Common phrase types:

| Phrase Type                   | What it centers around     | Example                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **NP** (Noun Phrase)          | a **noun** or pronoun      | “the black cat”, “she”, “John’s house” |
| **VP** (Verb Phrase)          | a **verb** and its objects | “ran away”, “has been sleeping”        |
| **PP** (Prepositional Phrase) | a **preposition + NP**     | “on the table”, “under the moon”       |
| **AdjP** (Adjective Phrase)   | describes a noun           | “very tall”, “extremely rude”          |
| **AdvP** (Adverb Phrase)      | modifies verbs/adjectives  | “very quickly”, “incredibly well”      |

💡 **A phrase = a group of related words working together as a unit.**

---

### 🔸 2. **Clauses** (the “containers”)

A **clause** contains both a **subject (NP)** and a **predicate (VP)**.
It **can** form a full sentence — or be part of a larger sentence.

| Clause Type            | Meaning                                                               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Independent Clause** | Can stand alone as a sentence (has a full idea). “I like pizza.”      |
| **Dependent Clause**   | Cannot stand alone. Needs an independent clause. “because it’s tasty” |

➡ So a sentence like:

> “I like pizza because it’s tasty.”
> …has:

* **Independent Clause**: “I like pizza”
* **Dependent Clause**: “because it’s tasty”

---

### 🧱 3. **Sentence = Clauses = Phrases = Tokens**

Let’s break one down.

> “An 80-year-long study has shown that good interpersonal relationships make people happier.”

#### Phrase Level:

* NP: “An 80-year-long study”
* VP: “has shown”
* NP: “good interpersonal relationships”
* VP: “make people happier”

#### Clause Level:

* Independent Clause:
  “An 80-year-long study has shown that good interpersonal relationships make people happier.”
* Embedded/Dependent Clause:
  “that good interpersonal relationships make people happier”

So this sentence is a **complex sentence** with an embedded clause introduced by “that”.

---

### 🧩 BONUS: Tree-style Breakdown (like an AST in code)

```
[SENTENCE]
 ├── [NP] An 80-year-long study
 ├── [VP]
 │    ├── has shown
 │    └── [CLAUSE]
 │         ├── [NP] good interpersonal relationships
 │         └── [VP] make people happier
```

If you’ve done parsing with `AST`, this is just a **parse tree** for language.

### 📦 TL;DR — Linguistic Structure Hierarchy

```
Tokens (words) → Phrases (NP, VP, etc.) → Clauses (Indep/Dep) → Sentence
```

And your translation system interacts at all 3 levels:

| Level       | Used for…                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tokens**  | `logprobs`, translation probability granularity         |
| **Phrases** | Segmenting for alternate phrasing (NP/VP recombination) |
| **Clauses** | Maintaining grammatical sense across phrase boundaries  |

### ✅ You're Now Ready To:

* Understand what *segments* really are.
* Use `spaCy` or GPT to extract NP/VPs.
* Offer phrase-level rewrites.
* Track how one clause change affects another.

Let me know if you want:

* Diagrams of how this looks over code
* A sentence you’d like me to walk through chunk-by-chunk
* Or the next concept (like constituency parsing or dependency trees) to build on this.
